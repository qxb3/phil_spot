Bummer our Plan A was cancelled due to high waves & high winds. We looked for an alternate 45 minutes from El Nido and this was Nacpan Beach. This is a pretty remote location. We were able to have a driver in a tricycle bring us out here and wait for about 1 1/2 as he has family in the area (lucky us). He went to see them and hopefully he returns at a suitable time.

Nacpan Beach is gorgeous, but unfortunately the currents were too strong to allow people to go swimming.

They also have a small restaurant on the beach. I ordered grilled fish (mackerel) & Garlic rice. The fish was Only 150 pesos. Go figure 2 pieces of whole fish for 150 pesos what a great deal. The only problem is they move at island speed. It took almost 45 minutes
Normally this wouldn't have been such a problem but our driver was suppose to be back in an 1 1/2hr and he actually showed up earlier (go figure Filipino time)
