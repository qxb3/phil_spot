Bon Bon Beach is hands down the best beach in the Philippines. Period. We came across a lot of stunningly beautiful places on our 2 months in the Philippines, but none were quite as special as Bon Bon Beach. The beach is “famous” for the long, narrow sandbar that stretches out into the ocean at the far end of the beach, almost connecting to a small island a few hundred metres from shore. Surrounded on 3 sides is the most incredibly blue and clear water in the entire country. It is actually quite similar to Cresta de Gallo island which is also in the Romblon province.
It is mind blowing, jaw dropping and eye-poppingly spectacular, all at the same time. I think you get the picture right?
To top it all off, there’s a good chance you can enjoy the best beach in the Philippines all to yourself! This is because Bon Bon (or Bonbon) Beach is found on Romblon Island, which is notoriously difficult to get to and therefore off the popular tourist track.
