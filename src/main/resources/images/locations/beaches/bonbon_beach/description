Bonbon Beach is an idyllic beach paradise located in the archipelagic province of Romblon, found in between Luzon and Visayas. It is well-known for its long stretch of white sandbar extending up to 2 kilometers and connects to another island, Bang-og. The sandbar is visible during low tide and you can walk to Bang-og Island too!​
If you want to have a great time at this beach and enjoy its crystal clear waters and stretch of white sand to its full extent, make sure to visit either early in the morning or in the late afternoon. It’s best to avoid going there from June to October because of the rain/typhoon season.
