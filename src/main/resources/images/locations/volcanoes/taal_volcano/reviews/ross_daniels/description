Very scary and awesome. Like most we climbed to the edge of the crater and it is a bit of a frightening site as it is one of the most active volcanoes in the country and has erupted numerous times in the past. Actually it is composed of a main crater and several smaller craters. The Main Crater Lake is approximately 2 kilometers in diameter and contains a small island called Vulcan Point. This point is the site of a number of volcanic vents and is considered to be the most active part of the volcano.
