Up for some daytime adventure? Try getting close to the 2nd active volcano in the Philippines. It’s worth the sweat and heat going on the trail. It’s really beautiful here and a perfect spot for IG photos if you’re into that. Check my review for the Trail. More cool photos available on my IG and reviews in the “Taal Lake”
