You can hike to the base of the volcanic crater in a day and than camp overnight. You than begin the hike to the crater in the early morning (approx 30mins). You get an amazing view of the entire region from the summit and if you are game peak over the edge into the active volcano. We were lucky enough to meet some locals that were hiking and are still friends. I would not consider the hike very difficult (2465m) pretty much anyone could complete it. We did get a permit for the hike in Bacolod city which was very easy. However, when we reached Guintubdan we were advised that you could obtain permits there (I don't know if this is still the case). There is accommodation in Guintubdan (it is very, very basic). We organised a guide who provided us with tent, sleeping bag etc. in Guintubdan. We did not book a porter but you can and you will need to buy your own food. There is a very small store in Guintubdan but don't expect much more than rice, canned ox and 2min noodles :-) This really is a spectacular, cheap hike to a volcano that many people overlook!!!! Also, loads of rooster farms in the area.
