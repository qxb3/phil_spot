The name "Kanlaon" is derived from the ancient Visayan deity Kan-Laon, which means "one who is revered" or "one who is elevated." The indigenous people living near the volcano believe that it is a sacred place with spiritual significance.
 
Mount Kanlaon is part of the Mount Kanlaon Natural Park, a protected area established in 1934 to preserve the volcano's biodiversity and natural habitats. The park covers approximately 24,557 hectares and is home to a variety of flora and fauna unique to the region.
