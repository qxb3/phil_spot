Very nice and easy trek. Lots of shade. Tour guide is needed. We went with tripinas. There’s an hour rough ride on a 4x4 to the trail head. I enjoyed interacting with the aetas, they’re really nice and happy! Make sure you bring food as the ones they sell is pricey because they have to hike it up. View is very beautiful at the crater. We also went to the waterfalls for 50 pesos each. Clear, relaxing and cold water after a warm day! :)
