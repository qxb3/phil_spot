Hiked in December & other trails during a month long trip to Philippines & posted a vlog on YouTube w/ tips & info so you can be prepared! Search "NCG Travel" [youtu.be/o160CkU4Ji0] Our trip was organized by Danny Mt. Pinatubo Tour w/ a 4x4 ride to the trailhead & a guide for the 7 mile hike. Very nice & enjoyable hike because it wasnâ€™t too hot or humid. Swam in a small pool along the trail.
