Good hike with the help of a tour guide. Went in April and the weather was cool in the morning up until 9-10am when the sun started to get stronger/weather hotter. Some shallow streams during the hike but you can balance on rocks to get across streams without getting wet. There can be lots of people at the crater- you may need to wait a bit to take pictures. Locals sell food along the way (drinks, snacks, hotdog, chicken inasal with rice, etc.) for about 100-200pesos. I suggest packing your own food/water if you want to save money. Overall I had fun!
