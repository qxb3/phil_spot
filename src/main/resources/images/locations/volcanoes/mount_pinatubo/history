Mount Pinatubo gained notoriety for its catastrophic eruption on June 15, 1991, which remains one of the largest volcanic eruptions in the 20th century. The eruption caused widespread destruction and resulted in approximately 800 deaths and over 200,000 displaced individuals. The explosion also had a significant impact on global climate patterns due to the large amount of sulfur dioxide released into the atmosphere.
