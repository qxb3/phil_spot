Mount Pinatubo (Bundok/Bulkang Pinatubo) is an active stratovolcano known for its largest eruption during the twentieth century.  Hikers will be asked at the jump-off point about the number of kilometers they want to hike. You must inform your guide where you'd like to be dropped off. Hiking poles or walking sticks are recommended when crossing the creeks. Public restrooms are also available along the trail, as well as some ice-cold drink stalls at the parking lot, midway, and at the summit. The view at the crater is breathtaking and marvelous! This adventure is astounding and beautiful beyond imagination. Wearing proper gear is recommended.
