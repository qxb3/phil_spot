(+) There is a few ziplines for you to choose from, some quite unique as I have never see it anywhere else (surfboard)
- Crew is helping in taking photos for me. I was a solo traveller and while i was on the bicycle and surfboard zipline, the crew use my phone and took photos and videos of me.

(-) The staff at the counter is not very helpful in providing more information on how the diff ziplines have different experiences.
- Need to be physically fit to walk up the stairs of the different ziplines.
