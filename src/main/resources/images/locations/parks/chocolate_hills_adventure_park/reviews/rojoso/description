We was visiting the ATV adventure park at the feet’s of chocolate hills. It was muddy, slippery, and f as fantastic fun :-) I was just a big smile for Long 30 minutes drive.
As a couple we took the ATV buggy, and it is easier and more fun to handle, you get more speed and dit safer.
I was also trying the ATV, it’s fun too but the handle bars gets slippery and the footrest also if the weather is wet and muddy tracks.
But fun, very fun!!
Also the tour is guided by a local driver which is needed , he was excellent and took good funny pictures:-)
In general, the trip to Bohol was great!!
Highly recommended:-)
