Thereâ€™s a lot of activities to do in Burnham Park. We chose to do the biking one and it was cheap for almost an hour. After visiting many times, it was my first time doing this activity.

Burnham Park is also improving the same as the other tourist attractions in Baguio. Now, they had a lot of food stalls nearby while biking in the area. They also keep the surroundings clean every time.
