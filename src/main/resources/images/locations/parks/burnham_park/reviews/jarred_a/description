Quite a bit to see and do for the whole family. When we visited it was super crowded, but that made it much more interesting and fun when we rented bikes and tricycles. The bike paths were super chaotic with kids counter-flowing and people crashing which was also actually pretty fun ðŸ˜‚. Nice park for a date, picnic, or just a place to chill.
