It was a nice place but it was not maintained properly. I do hope the local government would do something with it. The spot was really great as it was the peak, but the overall was not neat. I mean, if we really wanted to attract people other than the local, it should be presented very well. Just so sad that was never developed further.

The only steal we experience that day was the sea of clouds. Good thing we were able to catch it :)
