The Ticao Island Resort may not be the easiest place to get to, but then the best dive resorts tend to be off the beaten track. I spent a week at Ticao towards the end of January - what a place. I wanted for nothing... ...and certainly didn’t miss my phone, the doorbell or internet!!! The beachfront cabana was simple, but nipping clean, with effective air con and oodles of hot water. The restaurant staff ensured that my waistline continues to challenge the confines of my Sharkskin and the office team were ever-present with a smile. However, Ticao was about the diving. The dive centre is very friendly and effectively run. I enjoyed a great boat team and dive guide, who dropped us in the right place without fail... ...and swiftly fished us out at the end of every dive. Elvin had the misfortune of guiding for me throughout my stay! His timing was impeccable and ability to peer through the viz unmatched. In six days of diving, we encountered whale sharks on nine occasions and concluded the trip with a Thresher! Who could ask for more?! It might have been my first visit to Ticao, but hopefully it won’t be my last. Thanks to all for a great week.
