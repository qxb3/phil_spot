In the historical tapestry of La Trinidad, Mount Kalugong was originally known as "tayawan," a term denoting a place specifically designated for the Ibalois' cultural dance, "tayao." Gongs and drums echoed from its heights, establishing it as a dedicated space for the vibrant celebrations and cultural revelry associated with the "tayao" dance.
