I came here twice in my life already, first one was 9 years ago and second one this 2023. This time we did a road trip from Alona Beach in Panglao, stopovers for lunch and Tarsiers spotting. I realized it is better to visit this area during the dry season (Jan - April), so you see the hills in a nice brown chocolate color, while in may they are already quite green because of the rain.

Anyway. This is a worth to do visit when in the Philippines.
