The Chocolate Hills are a famous geological formation in Bohol Province, Philippines. They are conical karst hills made of marine limestone from the Late Pliocene to Early Pleistocene era. The hills are covered in green grass that turns brown during the dry season, giving them a chocolate-like appearance, hence their name. There are at least 1,260 hills spread over an area of more than 50 square kilometers. They are a popular tourist attraction and a natural wonder of the Philippines.
