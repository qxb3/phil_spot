A majestic baroque style church made centuries ago by Spaniards. It's one of four of this style in the Philippines, all four designated as a world heritage site by UNESCO. This is for good reason, it's quite beautiful. The area surrounding the church has been gentrified to accommodate tourists, though the church itself remains as pious as possible. It's worth seeing, praying, and absorbing the goodness.
