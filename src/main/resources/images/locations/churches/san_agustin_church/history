Built in the 16th century by Spanish Augustinian friars, San Agustin Church is the oldest stone church in the Philippines. It has played a significant role in the country's history, witnessing numerous events like the Galleon Trade and the Philippine Revolution. Despite facing earthquakes, fires, and the Battle of Manila in 1945, the church stands remarkably resilient, a testament to its sturdy construction and historical importance.
