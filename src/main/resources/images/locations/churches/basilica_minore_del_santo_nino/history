The original structure of the Basilica Minore del Santo Niño dates back to the mid-17th century. However, it has been destroyed by fire several times throughout history. The image of the Santo Niño, believed to be found miraculously unscathed amidst the ruins, has become a powerful symbol of hope and resilience for Filipinos. The current basilica building reflects a more contemporary architectural style, built in the 19th century.
