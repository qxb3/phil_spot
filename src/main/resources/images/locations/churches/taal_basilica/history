Construction of Taal Basilica began in the 17th century. However, the church has undergone several reconstructions due to natural disasters, particularly eruptions of the nearby Taal Volcano. The current structure reflects a more resilient design, showcasing a Neo-classical style. The basilica serves as a testament to the deep faith of the community and their unwavering spirit in the face of adversity.
