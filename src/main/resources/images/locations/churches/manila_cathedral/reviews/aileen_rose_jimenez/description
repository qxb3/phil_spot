The Mother Church of the Philippines. Loved the image of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception and the Adoration Chapel at the right facing the altar. Also, don't forget to visit the Jubilee Cross with the relic of St. John Paul II at the first section on the left facing the altar. The souvenir shop on the right also offers a number of religious items.
