Manila Cathedral is hands down one of the most stunning places you can visit in the Philippines. Seriously, the moment you step inside, you're hit with this overwhelming sense of awe and reverence. The architecture alone is mind-blowing â€“ those intricate carvings, the colorful stained glass windows, and don't even get me started on the altars. It's like stepping into another world.
