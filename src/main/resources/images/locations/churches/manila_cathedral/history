The construction of Manila Cathedral began in the 1570s but was repeatedly interrupted by earthquakes, fires, and wars. The present structure, completed in the late 19th century, reflects a more resilient design. The cathedral's long and complex history mirrors the turbulent times the Philippines has endured. The architectural styles present throughout the building showcase its numerous reconstructions and adaptations.
