This was the highlight of our stay in Iligan. You have to know though that to get down to the falls, you will go through 300+ steps and climb up the same steps to go back up and out of the falls. For me, each step was worth the experience. The young folks down there were quite skilled in mooring your raft to get nearer and under the falls. They don't mind your pictures and probably enjoy it. That's how we felt about Luis, who was so dynamically energetic and cheerful. He even stayed with our 71 year old aunt who took longer to go back up that unending staircase. Somewhere along the bend up there, I stopped to take a few sips of their spring water flowing through a clean split of bamboo. Also, there was a small sari-sari(variety) store of snacks, like chips and soda.
And a place to change back into dry clothing. I'm sure more patrons would come if there were some kind of lift or cable car, but as it is - it's almost perfect. Who loves crowds anyway.
