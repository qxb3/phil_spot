One of the best Waterfalls I’ve been. Tinago Falls is truly breath-taking, found in Linamon Iligan. It’s a must to bring Drinking water because the trail going to the waterfalls may take up to 30mins walk on a pave stairway. CR and parking space is available in the entrance, vest and Bamboo raft is also available.
