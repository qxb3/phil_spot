Tinago Falls has a rich history dating back centuries, when it was discovered and used by the indigenous Maranao people who lived in the surrounding areas. As Iligan City developed in the early 20th century, the falls became a popular recreational spot for locals and visitors, who would come to swim, bathe, and enjoy the natural scenery. In the 1960s, the local government of Iligan City began to promote Tinago Falls as a tourist attraction, building a staircase to make it more accessible to visitors. Over the years, the infrastructure and facilities around the falls were gradually improved, with the addition of viewing platforms, picnic areas, and other amenities to accommodate the growing number of tourists. Today, Tinago Falls is one of the top natural attractions in the Iligan City area, drawing visitors from around the world who come to admire its stunning 240-foot cascade and lush, tropical surroundings.
