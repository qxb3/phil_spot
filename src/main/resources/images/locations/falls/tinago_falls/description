Tinago Falls is a stunning and hidden gem in Lanao del Norte and Mindanao. This natural wonder is a must-visit destination, with its breathtaking beauty and unique features. The falls are surrounded by lush greenery and feature a 240-foot-high rock face that cascades down into a calm, cool, and blue water basin. The area is relatively untouched, with only man-made staircases and a few cottages to accommodate visitors. If you're looking to escape the hustle and bustle of the city and unwind, Tinago Falls is a great place to add to your list. For the more adventurous types, this destination is also a perfect fit - you'll need to trek down the 500 steps of the man-made stairway to reach the falls, making it a great test of patience and endurance. But trust us, the one-of-a-kind beauty of Tinago Falls is well worth the effort.
