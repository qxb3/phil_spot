Unlike many other waterfalls in the country which is rich in history, legend and even folklore, very little is known about Merloquet Falls. There is no legend to explain how it came about, no folklore to shroud it with mystery and drama. The name itself, Merloquet, intriguing as it is, has no interesting folklore behind it. What is known about the name though is that it probably came from the term “de omerloket,” which in Chavacano roughly translates to “from the place of omerloket.” To be referred to as “omerloket” in the native tongue of Zamboanga means that you are ignorant, uncouth or just downright dumb. How this derogatory term could give rise to the name of this majestic falls is beyond me, but it’s the closest explanation available so far. 


Practically every site you would come across featuring this place would describe it as a “white curtain in the midst of lush canopy trees.” It’s all that and more. Much, much more. You will not be in awe by the powerful descent of the waters from the mountains nor will you feel dizzy by its staggering height, for the charm of Merloquet Falls, in all its quiet beauty, lies not in its raging waters, but in its steady and calm cascades. There is really something unexplainable about the calming effect of witnessing water cascade steadily and peacefully down interesting rock formations.
