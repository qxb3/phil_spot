This is a beautiful stunning falls about 2 hour drive from Zamboanga city.When the short cut is ready it will cut the journey by half an hour.Our driver took the short cut going n the long way home.The shorter road still under construction n could be dangerous in rainy weather.
When you reach the falls...you parked your car n registered yourself at a small hut.There is a small shop in which you can buy water n titbits.Then you go down a flight of concrete steps 357 steps to reach the falls.
View is stunning.you can climb by a side road to reach the pool at the top.water unfortunately was not clear due to the rain the night before.you could swim in d shallow pool or just sit hours in the cascade of water.
Reserve some energy as you will need to climb 357 steps back up n that is tedious n sap your energy.
Entrance fee p5 n parking fee p20 n huts for rent p200.
