From zamboanga downtown, take a van/jeep for a 1.5 hrs travel, then from the main road another 30min by habal-habal (motorcycle) and lastly a good 30min hike in concrete steps with hand rails. Best to go here in the morning or mid day for picnic and marvel at this least visited falls due to security issues in the southern mindanao.

But we never felt insecure, or had to notify local tourism office. Just take extra precaution or better yet go with a local.

Minor con is that lowest tier is not advisable for swimming. Upper tier is great for groups and 'dreamy shots' (long exposure) as the splash is limited and the falls is wide spread like a curtain.
