Merloquet Falls appear on the tourist brochures for Zamboanga City, but they are not quite as accessible as you might suppose. This is an all day trip, but well worth the journey. It took about two and a half hours by van to get to the falls area. The main road was very good but the 'off road' to the falls was in a terrible state of repair and we had to get out of the van at one point to allow it to traverse the washed out roadway safely.
On arrival in the falls area there is a small shop that collects the entry fee for the falls - it's only 5 Pesos each but for an additional 100 Pesos you can use a covered picnic area right by the water falls.
Then the fun starts! There are 373 steps down to the falls area - I have to say that the actual stairway is 'world class' in that it is beautifully paved and the handrails and resting areas are very well done.
When you get down the steps you can see the falls. Although they are not the most incredible falls I've ever seen they surely rate as the most visitor friendly. The actual falls consist of a number of pools and rock ledges that allow you to climb right up into the water. The water isn't cold at all - it's more like 'swimming pool' temperature and on a hot day is a wonderful way to cool off. There isn't much else to say except 'enjoy' - but remember you have to climb those 373 steps on the way back!
