One of our tour's best moments! It's nice to be in touch with nature. Although it's nearly a 30-minute walk to the falls, and the road is difficult because you have to duck or hold onto rocks at times, it's exhausting (please wear comfortable footwear). But I'm still in awe of the falls' beauty, and I had the chance to swim here. If you enjoy trekking, I would recommend this. Local guides are available to assist you and will take pictures of your group.
