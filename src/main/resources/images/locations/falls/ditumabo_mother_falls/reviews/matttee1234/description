Nice water falls and a must see place in Baler. Going by tricycle you be be stopped at several places for collecting money for no reason. Government fees are nothing but the mere registration of all foreign tourist.Make sure you walk with sneakers as the roads are pretty rough, They have a picnic spot also with barbecue grills and huts.Water is cold and its really nice picturesque.
