Kawasan Falls has a rich history, it was considered a sacred site by the indigenous people of the area. The Spanish colonial era saw the falls named "Cascadas de Badian" and the construction of a small chapel nearby, while the American period brought a road to the falls, making it easier for visitors to access. After World War II, the falls became a popular spot for locals and tourists alike, with the Philippine government establishing a national park in 1996 to protect the area's natural resources and cultural heritage. Today, Kawasan Falls is a major tourist destination, attracting visitors from around the world while still being respected as a sacred site by many locals.
