Literally the best thing I’ve done in Cebu, Philippines. This place is like the Garden of Eden with beautiful greenery, magical waterfalls, crystal blue water, butterflies and dogs. This was my kind of Heaven.

We stayed in Moalboal and it was a 40min scooter ride to this place not the easiest for us to find but locals are more then happy to point you in the right direction. We went early in the morning to beat the crowds which I recommend doing. We didn’t do a Canyoneering Tour which you can do if you want too we didn’t book any tour or package. We just paid to park our scooter at the church and paid the admittance fee to see the falls and swim

Highly recommend visiting here it’s stunning 🤍
