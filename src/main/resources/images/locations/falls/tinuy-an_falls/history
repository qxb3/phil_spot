Tinuy-an Falls, also known as Tinago Falls, has a rich history that dates back to the days of the Madgiwala Mountain Settlers, who were once enslaved by cruel tribesmen from the Agusan region. The settlers' bravery and determination to escape led them to push their bamboo raft over the falls, giving the area its name "Tinuy-an" which is derived from the Cebuano word "tinuyo-an", meaning "an intentional act or performance to attain an objective or goal". The falls were first discovered by local residents in the 1980s, who would visit the area for bathing and washing clothes. In the 1990s, the local government and tourism authorities began developing the area to promote it as an ecotourism destination, improving access and building facilities. Today, Tinuy-an Falls is one of the most famous and picturesque waterfalls in the Philippines, attracting thousands of visitors each year who come to marvel at its natural beauty.
