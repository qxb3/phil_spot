Mount Arayat is a potentially active stratovolcano with a breached crater and andesitic dome. The last report of this volcano erupting was over 2,000 years ago. Legend is that this mountain/volcano is home to the Diwata Maria Sinukuan also known as a Fairy. As locals say now, the mountain is under tremendous threat of deforestation, and the primary reason is that the mountain (legend) is angry. This mountain was also used as a hiding zone for communist Filipino guerrillas during World War II.
