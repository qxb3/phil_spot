Mount Arayat, Pampanga, Philippines
Jun 2018 â€¢ Family
Mount Arayat is a very large and wide mountain with many trees and old rocks over a vast area. Ascending and descending the mountain is quite challenging because it is a steady upward climb and has steep slopes/trails. I would highly recommend that you hire a local guide who is an expert of the mountain because it is very easy to get disoriented and lose your way.
You will need a whole day for this adventure so start your hiking very early unless you are planning to camp overnight. This is a mountain that has full of fairy tales among Filipinos yet it is believed to be sacred.
While having an amazing trekking as always please respect the nature and stay safe!
