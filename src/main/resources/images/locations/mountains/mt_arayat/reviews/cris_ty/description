My and my son's first major climb. The Mt. Arayat is a no joke to climb. In my experience, the backbreaking part is the lateral trail through the boulders and that you will hold onto the big roots of trees. That part, I was far from our guide and companions that if I have to wait on them will consume my energy much. I am puzzled where to place my hands and feet as I advanced my steps. It's like torturing my body and mind. Glad, I didn't panic! Also, I was thinking about the chance of surviving if the heavy rain falls. Yes, it rained that day but with fine drops falling. Lucky day!
