Our kind, local guide told us that there is no guarantee that we can see the sea of clouds once we arrive at the summit. So, my friends and I crossed our fingers, and prayed, like hard pray. We started our trek at 1 am to see the sunrise. For an average hiker, it may take 4 hours to reach the summit and my friends were first time hikers so better head out early or be sorry. Around 100 meters before reaching the summit, we could already see the clouds beneath us. It was breathtaking, and honestly, It was my first time to witness such beauty, a striking balance of the golden sun rays and pockets of clouds right in front of us. I rate this experience 5/5 and rate the trail as 2/10 depending on a person’s level of hiking experience. It’s not that steep, rather a long trek. Although some may find it difficult especially when it rains, the path can be very slippery so come prepared with a good hiking gear/waterproof hiking boots. And If the Heavens hear you, you’ll be in for a treat.
Conditions: No shade, Slippery, Great!
