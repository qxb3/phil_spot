The views of the local terraced farms and interesting landscapes are worth the hike. The trail is well maintained in certain areas, and a giant pool of sloppy muck beyond camp 2 especially if it has been raining. We started at 1am to summit for the sunrise viewing thinking the light drizzle at the trailhead would clear up by sunrise, but it ended up being typhoon-like conditions at the peak with sideways rain and 60+ mph winds. The combination of wet and windy conditions at the summit can easily lead to hypothermia although the temps are above freezing. Our guides wore waterproof tops, pants and rain galoshes and looked totally dry. I wore a waterproof jacket and waterproof hiking boots and was completely soaked. Definitely include weather proof and warm layers.
