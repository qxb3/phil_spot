We planned this trip as a 3 day, 2 night trip with Mt. Apo Adventures, but we ended up able to complete the hike in two days! Albert was very experienced in helping us prepare, and met us the night before and the morning of to ensure a safe journey. Views on the Santa Cruz Trail were incredible, we especially liked the farm section in the beginning. The campsite was busy with other groups, there is clean drinking water at the camp, one working toilet, and the food was amazing. Special thanks to Rey, our main guide, who cooked and guided us to the top. My partner has never climbed a mountain before, and even though this is a physically challenging hike, we are in average shape and were able to complete the hike early (the second day was quite long). Overall, both of us would 100 percent recommend Mt. Apo Adventures to organize their trek, and definitely try climbing this mountain!
